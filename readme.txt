Muhammad Azhar Rohiman - RHMMUH005. CSC3022H - Lab 4.

Instructions on how to compile, run and use the program:

1) cd to folder containing cpp and h files. 'cd Week4'

2) type 'make' command in terminal to create object and executable files

3) type 'make clean' to remove object and executable files

4) 3 perceptrons are needed to solve the XOR problem.
   There must be two inputs to two perceptrons (and OR perceptron and a NAND perceptron) each. Both perceptrons must output
   and be used as an input to a third perceptron (AND) to get the XOR output.

Feel free to contact me on rhmmuh005@myuct.ac.za if you encounter any issue. Thank you.
